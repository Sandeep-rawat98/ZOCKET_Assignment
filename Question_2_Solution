Steps of the ETL Process:

	1. Extract: Retrieve the data from the source RDS.
	2. Transform: Process and manipulate the data as per business requirements.
	3. Load: Insert the transformed data into the target data warehouse or database.
	
Factors to Consider:

	1. Data Volume and Frequency: Understand the volume of data and how frequently it changes. This affects the choice of extraction strategy (full load, incremental load).
	
	2.Data Quality and Consistency: Ensure the data extracted is clean and consistent. Implement validation checks.
	Performance: Optimize queries to minimize load on the source database. Consider parallel extraction and batch processing.
	
	3.Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to track failures and recover from errors.
	
	4.Security: Secure the data in transit and at rest. Use encryption and secure connections (e.g., SSL/TLS).
	
	5.Scalability: Ensure the ETL process can scale with increasing data volume and complexity.
	
	6.Scheduling and Automation: Schedule the ETL jobs using a reliable scheduler to ensure timely data availability.
	
	7.Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring to track the health and performance of the ETL process, and set up alerts for any issues.
