To extract and transform event-based user data from CleverTap into a usable format for further analysis, you need to build a robust ETL pipeline. Below is an outline of the key components of such a pipeline along with the steps involved in the extraction, transformation, and loading of the data.

Key Components of the ETL Pipeline
	1. Data Source Integration:
		API Integration: Use CleverTapâ€™s REST API to fetch event data.
		Authentication: Handle API keys and any required authentication mechanisms.
		
	2. Data Extraction:

		API Requests: Schedule regular API requests to CleverTap to fetch the latest event data.
		Batch Processing: Fetch data in manageable batches to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
		
	3. Data Storage:
		Temporary Storage: Use a staging area (e.g., cloud storage or a temporary database) to store raw event data.
		Data Warehouse: Store processed data in a data warehouse (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).

	4. 	Data Transformation:
		Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any anomalies.
		Normalization: Convert data into a consistent format and structure.
		Enrichment: Add additional context or derived metrics.
		Aggregation: Summarize event data for easier analysis (e.g., daily active users, session duration).

	5.	Data Loading:
		Incremental Load: Load new or updated data into the data warehouse.
		Full Load: Occasionally perform a full reload of data to ensure consistency.

	6.	Automation and Scheduling:
		Job Scheduler: Use tools like Apache Airflow, AWS Glue, or cron jobs to automate the ETL pipeline.
		Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring to track pipeline health and logging for error diagnosis.

	7.	Data Access and Analytics:
		BI Tools: Integrate with business intelligence tools like Tableau, Looker, or Power BI.
		SQL Access: Enable direct SQL querying for advanced analysis.
