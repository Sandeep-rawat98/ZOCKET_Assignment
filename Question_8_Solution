Effective monitoring and logging strategies are crucial for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of ETL pipelines. Below are some strategies for monitoring various components of the pipeline and handling error scenarios.

Monitoring Strategies
	1. Centralized Logging:
		Log Aggregation: Use a centralized logging system like the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd to aggregate logs from all components.
		Structured Logging: Ensure logs are structured (e.g., JSON format) to facilitate querying and analysis.

	2. Metrics Collection:
		Application Metrics: Collect metrics such as execution time, data volume processed, success/failure counts, and resource usage (CPU, memory).
		Infrastructure Metrics: Monitor the underlying infrastructure (e.g., node health, disk usage, network I/O) using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
		
	3. Alerting and Notifications:
		Threshold-based Alerts: Set up alerts for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, low throughput, resource exhaustion).
		Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior.
		Notifications: Use tools like PagerDuty, Slack, or email to notify the relevant teams in case of alerts.
		
	4. Dashboards:
		Real-time Dashboards: Create real-time dashboards using Grafana or Kibana to visualize key metrics and logs.
		Custom Dashboards: Tailor dashboards to show the status and performance of specific ETL components.
		
Handling Error Scenarios:
		
	1. Error Detection and Logging:
		Detailed Error Logging: Ensure that all errors and exceptions are logged with sufficient details to facilitate troubleshooting.
		Error Codes and Context: Use error codes and include contextual information (e.g., data IDs, processing stage) in logs.
		
	2. Automated Retry Mechanisms:
		Retry Policies: Implement retry policies for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts, temporary unavailability).
		Exponential Backoff: Use exponential backoff strategies for retries to avoid overwhelming resources.
		
	3. Fallback and Graceful Degradation:
		Fallback Mechanisms: Design fallback mechanisms for critical failures (e.g., switch to a backup data source).
		Graceful Degradation: Ensure the pipeline can continue to operate in a degraded mode when non-critical components fail.
		
	4. Error Handling and Recovery:
		Automated Recovery: Implement automated recovery scripts to handle common failure scenarios (e.g., restarting failed tasks).
		Manual Intervention: Provide clear runbooks and procedures for manual intervention when automated recovery is not possible.
		
	5. Data Validation and Quality Checks:
		Pre-Processing Validation: Validate incoming data for schema compliance, null values, and data types before processing.
		Post-Processing Validation: Ensure the processed data meets quality criteria (e.g., range checks, consistency checks) before loading it into the destination.
